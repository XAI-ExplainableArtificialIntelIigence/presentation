                        <h2>Explainable Decision Support Systems</h2>
                        </br>


                        Best Idea Ever: Implement a pseudo decision support system (Should I read this paper: Did you read it before? y-> Did you understand it? y-> Were there changes since the last time you read? n-> dun readit kek)

                        Decision support systems become increasingly important in our every day lifes. Examples can be found in medicine and law, amongst other domains. Consider doctors that consult computer programmes to analyse a patient and get recommendations for potential treatments. Or tax software which asks the right questions for you to make the optimal finencial decisions given the legal and financial situation you find yourself in. Already today we can see the impact that decision support systems have.
                        </br>
                        However, more often than not, those systems are so called black box systems, meaning that their inner workings are unknown, in some cases not only to the users, but even to the developers. This can have serious rammifications: Thinking of the medical example given above, the reader may ask themselves whether they would trust a decision made by a computer for reasons unkown to us! The savvy reader might  be inclined to trust the machine, but the issue is at least controversial and shows that a lack of understanding a decision making process might lead to a lack of confidence in the decision came by that process.

                        Beyond trust issues, even legal or moral implications need to be considered: Change your perspective from the patient to the doctor. Are you willing to take responsibility for the decision you make based on the computer-aided system? And if you do, can you be held accountable for them, given that you had no full knowledge of the underlying reasoning? These, again, are undecided matters.

                        <h2>Arguments and Rules</h2>
                        To gain insights into the rationale behind decisions made or supported by a computer system, we laverage the relation between rules and arguments. Both rules and arguments exhibit a similiar logical structure:
                        <\br>
                        A rule checks whether a number of conditions apply. If they do, then the rule tells what action should follow.
                        <\br>
                        An argument checks whether a number of reasons hold. If they do, then the argument tells us what consequence should be concluded.
                        <\br>
                        Out approach, figuratively speaking, is to utilize this similarity in their logical structure to map the decisions of a decision support system to reasons which should be found in the application domain, i.e. the medical or juridical field.
                        <\br>
                        The advantage of that approach is that ...



                        <h2>Explainable Decisions via Argumentation</h2>
                        Our approach to explainable decisions support systems is to explicate the rules underlying a decision support system within a given domain. We then analize the relation between these rules and under which conditions they apply. Finally, we bring this analysis back to the decision support system so that given any decision, we can explicate the rationale leading to that decision.

                        (This is then, by nature, limited to some kinds of decision support systems.
