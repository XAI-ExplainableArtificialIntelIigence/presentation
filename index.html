                                <p>Decision support systems become increasingly important in our everyday lives. If you are not sure how a decision support system might look like, try the example we provide on the right side. More sophisticated examples can be found in medicine and law, amongst other domains. Consider doctors that consult computer programmes to analyse a patient’s case and get recommendations for potential treatments. Or tax software, which asks the right questions for you to make the optimal financial decisions, given the legal and financial situation you find yourself in.
                                </p><p>Already today we can see the impact that decision support systems have. However, they are often so called black box systems, meaning that even the developers don’t always understand how they obtain their results.

                                <p>The core problem that this research project is concerned with is how we can make sense of the rationale behind the decisions coming from a decision support system. Our approach is to utilize a well understood model of such reasoning: Argumentation systems. </p><p>Consider the following example:
                                </br>
                                Assuming we know that:
                                </br>
                                1) Sokrates is human.</br>
                                2) All humans are mortal.</br>
                                Then we can conclude that:</br>
                                3) Sokrates is mortal. </br>
                                </br>

                                We can say that 3) follows from 1) and 2). Thus, if we believe that 1) and 2) are true, then these are our reasons for why we should also believe 3). </p><p>While this example might seem easy to understand, things can get complicated quickly when you consider many different facts and rules, as might be the case in the domains mentioned above. </p><p>That is where logics and, more specifically, argumentation systems come into play: They provide us with the necessary set of formal tools to handle such problems computationally. The key point, here, is that the reasons within such a system can be made explicit.
                                </br>The main idea behind this project, then, is to utilize argumentation systems to augment decision support systems.</p>

                                <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                                <ul>
                                <li>What are the requirements for the explanations that an automated decision system has to provide, such that we can understand why and how a certain decision was made?</li>
                                <li>Is it possible to provide an adequate explanation with each decision, as in different fields the user might need different level of understanding of the decision process? </li>
                                <li>Legal specifications create specific rules for making decisions. Thus, we will investigate if these rules can be used to automatically generate a decision system that provides explanations with the decisions made.</li>
                                </br>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                                <ul>
                                <li>We implemented an argumentation system that given a question and a set of rules, formulated in defeasible logic, provides arguments for and against a decision. Defeasible logic is a logical system that can model the interactions between different arguments especially well. This outcome marks a major mile stone, as it gives us the founation upon which to build the explainable decision support system. A stand-alone application of the results can be inspected at a dedicated <a href="https://xai.davidpomerenke.vercel.app/defeasible-tableau.html">web page</a>.</li>
                                <li>More results will be added as the project progresses.</li>
                                </ul>

The savvy reader might be inclined to trust the machine, but the issue is at least controversial. It shows that a lack of understanding a decision making process might lead to a lack of confidence in the decision made.

                                                    Beyond trust concerns, even legal or moral implications need to be considered: Change your perspective from the patient to the doctor. Would you take responsibility for the decisions you make based on the computer-aided system? And if you would, can you be held accountable for them, given that you had no full knowledge of the underlying reasoning? These, again, are undecided matters.

We can imagine it like the doctor who needs to ask more and more specific questions of the patient to hone in on his diagnosis.
                                                    However, for these logical systems to work, they need to have all the relevant information available for each conclusion they should check. On the other hand, this is where decision support systems excel. They are built in such a way that the information considered for coming up with a decision expands with each question asked. So ideally, by combining the two systems, we get the best of both worlds.</p>
